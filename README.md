# Redesign-Goodreads
Last summer, I collaborated with 4 of my peers and redesigned the Goodreads app using Figma and AdobeXD. Being avid Goodreads users ourselves, we worked to solve the user interface and design issue of the mobile app. My 3 years of Fine Arts school became handy for the project as it helped me in color palette selection, app interface redesigning, theme selection, font style, color and sizing, all done according to the user data gained from the 50+ interviews with Goodreads users. The data analysis and data visualization knowledge of Stata, R and SQL from my Statistics class helped me analyze the user data and make meaningful connections to our redesign.
